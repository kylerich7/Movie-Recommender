# Movie Recommender
A program that analyzes over 3000 movies and 10,000 ratings and provides movie recommendations. After rating
a set of movies, the recommender will compare your ratings against other similar raters and suggest movies accordingly.

I built this as a final project for a Duke University coursera course I took. My motivation was to learn more about algorithms and working
with big sets of data.
