# Movie Recommender
A program that analyzes over 3000 movies and 10,000 ratings and provides movie recommendations. After rating
a set of movies, the recommender will compare your ratings against other similar raters and suggest movies accordingly.

with big sets of data.

## Built With
IntelliJ IDEA

After cloning, import all libraries in the lib folder

## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.
